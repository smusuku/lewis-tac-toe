## Key Learning Goals

- Build an application using modern React syntax (no classes).  
- Manage component hierarchy and state effectively.  
- Configure hosting on Microsoft Azure via GitHub integration.  
- Document progress and maintain high-quality coding standards.

---

## Technologies Used

- React.js and JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js and npm
- Azure Static Web Apps
- GitHub for source control
